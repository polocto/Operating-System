## A Defenition

A **semaphore** is an object with an **int** value that can be manipulate by `sem_wait()` & `sem_post()`. **Semaphore** can be shared by threads from a same process. **Semaphore declaration:**
```c
#include <semaphore.h>
sem_t s; //declaration of a semaphore variable
sem_init(&s, 0, 1); //sem_init(variable, config, value);
```
Once the **semaphore variable** is declare we can call the two function: `sem_wait()` & `sem_post()`. We have to be very careful about how we going to call those **[critical section](26.Threads-Intro.md#glossary)**.

```c
int sem_wait(sem_t*s) 
{
    //decrement the value of semaphore s by one
    //wait if value of semaphore s is negative
}

int sem_post(sem_t*s) 
{
    //increment the value of semaphore s by one
    //if there are one or more threads waiting, wake one
}
```
When the **semaphore's value is negative**, it is equal to the **number of waiting threads**.

## Binary Semaphores (Locks)

```c
sem_t m;
sem_init(&m, 0, X); // initialize to X; what should X be?

sem_wait(&m);
// critical section here
sem_post(&m);
```
>X should be equal to 1
